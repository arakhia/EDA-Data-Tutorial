Exploratory Data Analysis Tutorial with code samples in Python

## Project Overview

This is a tutorial on how to do simple exploratory data analysis with Python. The dataset that has been used in this project is called Student Academics Performance Data Set and I took it from UCI Machine Learning Repository, here is the citation for it

## Contents

* Convert & Load the dataset
* Get an Overview about the data e.g. samples, columns, mean and others
* data cleaning (if required), check for missing values or delete unwated columns
* Factorizing the data using Pandas
* Data Visualization, show correlation matrix or factorplot between multiple columns
* Train & Test split using SKlearn (Not Implemented Yet)
* Running bunch of ML models and observe the results (Not Implemented Yet)

Furthermore, I will keep updating this repo, when I've time, however, if you have any idea and would like to apply it, I will be happy to support that.
